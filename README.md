🎬 Netflix Login Page Clone

A front-end UI replication of the Netflix login page, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deployed on Vercel.
This project focuses on understanding layout structure, visual design accuracy, and responsive web practices by recreating one of the most recognizable login interfaces on the web.

🧠 Overview

The Netflix Login Page Clone was developed to practice real-world front-end design skills.
It’s not a full-stack clone — there’s no backend authentication or API integration — but rather a UI-focused implementation designed to test layout precision, responsiveness, and styling consistency.

Each component, from the background gradient to the input fields and button states, was built manually to mirror the authentic Netflix experience.
